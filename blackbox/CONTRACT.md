# The outside of the `vm` program

What the black-box tests assume about the program. Tests are written from this file and the tickets' acceptance criteria; the implementation conforms to it. A change to the outside is made here first.

Each section says which ticket introduced it. Words in capitals are from `CONTEXT.md`.

## How the tests get the program

The harness runs `cargo build -p vm --bin vm` once and starts `target/debug/vm`, unless the environment variable `VM_BIN` names a binary to use instead. `blackbox` depends on no product crate.

## Serving (ticket: Walking skeleton)

### Starting and stopping

```
vm serve --domain <domain> --listen <ip:port> --application <name>=<path> [--application ...] [--stand-in-sign-in]
```

- `--domain` is the installation's domain. `--listen 127.0.0.1:0` picks a free port.
- `--application <name>=<path>` names a fixture Application: `<path>` is one JavaScript file, a classic script. At least one is required. This option exists only until Applications live in the platform database.
- An Application's name is a DNS label in lower case: letters, digits and hyphens, 1 to 63 characters, not starting or ending with a hyphen.
- A start-up that cannot work exits non-zero with a message on standard error naming the problem: a name that is not a DNS label, a name given twice, a file that cannot be read, no Application.
- The program writes its log to standard error, one JSON object per line, each with `"event"` and `"time_ms"`.
- When it is ready to serve it writes `{"event":"listening","address":"127.0.0.1:<port>","stand_in_sign_in":<bool>, ...}`.
- It is stopped by ending the process. Nothing is promised about requests in flight at that moment.

### Addresses

- A request whose `Host` is `<application>.<domain>` goes to that Application. Letter case and a port in `Host` are ignored.
- Tests connect to the listening address and set `Host`.

### Stand-in sign-in

A development-only way for a caller to state who the User is. Real sessions replace it later without the rest of this file changing.

- It does nothing unless the program was started with `--stand-in-sign-in`.
- `x-vm-stand-in-user: <id>` states the User, exactly once. `x-vm-stand-in-groups: g1,g2` states their Groups; optional, at most once; entries are trimmed, empty ones dropped, repeats kept once.
- Values are UTF-8 and are handed over unchanged; a User id need not be ASCII. A value of 256 bytes is accepted.
- Malformed (two User headers, two Groups headers, an empty User, control characters, bytes that are not UTF-8, a value longer than 256 bytes): `400`. When the stand-in is off these headers are not looked at, so they are never malformed.
- Groups keep the order in which they were first stated.
- Every request header whose name starts with `x-vm-`, in any letter case, is removed before the request reaches Application code, whether the stand-in is on or off.

### Responses the program itself gives

Checked in this order:

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| No `Host` | 400 |
| Sign-in malformed | 400 |
| Not signed in (this includes every request when the stand-in is off) | 401 |
| `Host` is not `<application>.<domain>` for a known Application | 404 |
| The Application threw, rejected, answered with something that is not a `Response`, or failed while loading | 500 |

- Sign-in is checked before the Application is looked up, so someone who is not signed in cannot learn which Applications exist.
- These bodies are `text/plain`, between 1 and 200 bytes. The `401` body is the same whatever was asked for. The `500` body is fixed: it holds neither the error's message nor its stack.
- Every response carries `x-vm-request-id`, unique per request.

### What the log records per request

| `event` | Fields |
|---|---|
| `printed` | `request`, `application`, `user`, `level`, `message` |
| `uncaught` | `request`, `application`, `user`, `error` (message and stack) |
| `host-call` | `request` (or null), `application`, `user` (or null), `operation`, `outcome` (`allowed` or `refused`), `reason` (when refused) |
| `request` | `request`, `application` (or null), `user` (or null), `method`, `path`, `status` |

- `request` in these records is the value of `x-vm-request-id`. `user` is the User's id. `level` is the name of the console method. `path` is the path without the query.
- For a `400` or `401`, `application` and `user` are null. For a `404`, `user` is the signed-in User's id and `application` is null.
- The `request` record is written last for its request, before the response is sent: no record carrying a request's id comes after it, also when the Application left calls unawaited. A `host-call` record is written when the host decides, and an allowed one always names its request.
- A `printed` record from code that runs after its request ended, or while a script loads, has a null `request`.
- "No Application code ran" for a request means: no `printed`, `uncaught` or `host-call` record carries its id.

### What an Application is handed

- An Application is a classic script that registers its handler by assigning `globalThis.default = { fetch(request, ctx) { ... } }`. `fetch` may be async and returns a `Response`.
- Every request gets a fresh context. The script's top level runs again for each request, before the handler, **with no request in flight**. Nothing in memory survives from one request to another. The program may also run a script's top level when it starts, equally with no request in flight.
- `request` is a standard `Request`: the method, `http://<host><path-and-query>`, the headers without any `x-vm-*`, and the body.
- `ctx` is frozen. `ctx.user()` returns a frozen `{ id: string, groups: string[] }`: the User of the request in flight, as the host knows it. Called when the request is over, it throws an `Error` whose message starts with `no request in flight`.
- What the Application prints with `console.log` / `info` / `warn` / `error` / `debug` appears as `printed` records.

### The raw host interface

The SDK wraps this later; Application authors never write it by hand. Fixture Applications use it directly.

- `env.VM.invoke(operation, args)` returns a Promise of either `{ ok: <value> }` or `{ refused: { refusal: { reason: <string>, ... }, fix: <string> } }`. It does not reject for a refusal.
- The host decides who is asking from the request in flight, read on entry. Nothing the Application passes, sets or overwrites changes that.
- Operation `whoami` (no arguments) answers `{ ok: { user: { id, groups }, application: <name>, request: <request id> } }`.
- Called with no request in flight (at the top level while loading, or from a timer or a kept reference after the request ended): refused with reason `no-request`. Code left running after its request may also simply never run; what must not happen is a call that is allowed.
- An operation the host does not know: refused with reason `unknown-operation`.
- Outbound `fetch` from Application code is refused (it rejects) until the ticket on outbound calls.

### Refusal reasons

Kebab-case strings, the same everywhere a refusal is reported (to Application code, in the log, later in the Operation log and in the tool's output). Known so far: `no-request`, `unknown-operation`. Reserved for the tickets that introduce them, as tried with Coding agents in `docs/research/agent-facing-discovery.md`: `not-declared`, `declared-lower`, `no-grant`, `not-registered`, `not-own-database`.
